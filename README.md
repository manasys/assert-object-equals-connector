# AssertObjectEquals Anypoint Connector

## Mule supported versions
Mule 3.8/3.9 (tested just this, probably also works with 3.6/3.7)
In case you are working with Mule 4.x, have a look [here](https://gitlab.codecentric.de/danijel.dragicevic/assert-object-equals-module), there you find a version suitable for Mule 4.

## Installation
For beta connectors you can download the source code and build it with devkit to find it available on your local repository. Then you can add it to Studio

For direct installation within AnypointStudio, go to Help -> Install new Software... and add the 
[Update site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbutenuth/assert-object-equals-connector/master/update-site/)

When you use Maven: Released versions of the connector are on Maven Central, so you don't need to add a repository.
